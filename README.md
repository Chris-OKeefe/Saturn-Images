## 1. Saturn with the sun behind it. 
Cassini
 took 165 images over three hours in 2006. They were stitched together 
to create this extraordinary image of the gas giant hanging in space, 
shadowing Cassini from the sun. The backlighting revealed new, 
previously unknown rings. Up and to the left of the brightest ring is a 
tiny white dot – Earth, almost a billion miles away.  NASA / Cassini / Via saturn.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 2. Geysers on Enceladus. 
This 
image from 2009 shows great plumes of salt water bursting from the 
surface of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons. It’s good evidence that 
there is a huge ocean of salty water beneath the icy crust of the little
 world. Scientists think Enceladus is one of the most promising places 
to look for alien life in our solar system.  NASA / Cassini / Via saturn.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 3. Saturn and two of her daughters. 
Dione and Titan (Titan’s the big one), two of Saturn’s moons, in front of the planet and its rings, taken in 2011.  NASA / Cassini / Via photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 4. A new look at Jupiter. 
We’re 
used to seeing Jupiter from level with its equator, with its horizontal 
stripes. But in 2000, Cassini flew “underneath” it to take this 
composite picture of its south pole. The famous Great Red Spot is 
towards the top left of the image.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 5. A map of a world. 
And 
here’s the more usual side-on view of Jupiter, taken from 36 colour 
images and expanded into the most detailed map of the planet ever made.  NASA / Cassini / Via photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 6. Tethys, Enceladus, and Mimas. 
Three moons, floating either side of Saturn’s rings.  NASA / Cassini / Via saturn.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 7. Saturn in close-up. 
Cassini
 was still 12 million miles away from Saturn when it took this beautiful
 image, but the gas giant is so enormous that it already wouldn’t fit 
into the camera frame. The little pale dot below Saturn’s south pole is 
Enceladus.  NASA / Cassini / Via nasa.gov 

## 8. A view of a hidden world. 
Titan’s
 atmosphere is opaque with cloud, so ordinary photos can’t show the 
surface. Cassini took this composite image using infrared light – heat –
 which allowed it to see the dunes, highlands and craters of the huge 
moon.  NASA / Cassini / Via saturn.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 9. A gap in Saturn’s halo. 
To give
 you a sense of how enormous the rings of Saturn are, that black gap 
between the bright inner ring and the fainter middle one is 3,000 miles 
across.  NASA / Cassini / Via photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 10. A giant and her baby. 
Another
 way of sensing the scale of Saturn – that’s Tethys, one of its moons, 
to the bottom right, utterly dwarfed by the vast planet. Tethys has been
 artificially brightened to make it more visible.  NASA / Cassini / Via photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov 

## 11. Rings and shadow. 
Tethys 
with Saturn in the background. Saturn’s rings, almost edge-on, are 
visible at the top of the picture, while the lines beneath are the 
shadows the rings cast against the planet’s surface.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 12. Little and large. 
Enceladus peeps out from behind its larger sibling, Dione.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 13. Cracks in the ice of Enceladus. 
The icy
 surface of Enceladus, showing a Y-shaped feature caused by the ice 
slowly moving, pushed by the tectonic forces of the little world.  NASA / Cassini / Via nasa.gov 

## 14. Dione passes across the face of Saturn. 
With the rings bisecting the picture.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 15. Another look at Dione. 
This 
photo was taken in a wavelength that’s absorbed by the gas methane, 
which is abundant in Saturn’s atmosphere, so the giant planet looks dark
 while Dione shines brightly.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 16. Titan and Rhea. 
Saturn’s two largest moons align.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov 

## 17. Winter on Saturn. 
The 
southern hemisphere of Saturn is entering its winter – when it tilts 
away from the sun – and develops a bluish tint as it does so. This photo
 is taken in real colour.  NASA / Cassini / Via jpl.nasa.gov
